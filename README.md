Malaria Detection.



ðŸ“œ Iâ€™m thrilled to share my latest project , where Iâ€™ve been working on an innovative approach to malaria detection using Deep learning. This project has been a challenging and rewarding journey, and Iâ€™m proud of the progress made.

ðŸ§¬ The project involves developing algorithms that can accurately identify malaria-infected cells from microscopic images, which could significantly aid in early diagnosis and treatment.
